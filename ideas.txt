# API measurement tool:
 1. Determines scaling characteristics of each api call.
 2. Measurable quantities is:
    1. CPU consumption per call.
    2. Memory consumption per call.
    3. File Descritors, sockets, per call
    4. Persistence of above per call.
    5. Bandwidth per call.
    6. Which systems does this trigger?
        - Load Balancers
        - Databases
        - redis cache stores
        - sqs queues
        - kafka

# Per Application DNS monitoring
How?
 - Monitor all socket creations for DNS endpoint (as defined by resolv.conf)
 - Monitor DNS traffic.

# Hell, per application wireshark. Wouldn't that be great.
 - SystemTap might do this?
 - Partial problem: need to handle applications that bypass getaddrinfo,
 but this should be doable.
 - Does Nagios-core do this?
